# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe 2025 (C Language Project)

A terminal-based Tic-Tac-Toe game built in C with authentication, persistent player statistics, AI difficulty levels, and a tournament system.

This project was developed during my **First Semester of B.Tech (CSE)** as part of my college final evaluation project.
